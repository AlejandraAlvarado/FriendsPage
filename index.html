                F·R·I·E·N·D·S es una serie de
                televisión estadounidense creada y producida por Marta Kauffman y David Crane. Se emitió por primera vez
                el 22 de septiembre de 1994 por la cadena NBC y duró hasta el 6 de mayo de 2004.
                <br>
                <br>
                La serie trata sobre la vida de un grupo de amigos —Chandler Bing, Phoebe Buffay, Mónica Geller, Ross
                Geller, Rachel Green y Joey Tribbiani— que residen en Manhattan, Nueva York. Suceden tanto buenos como
                malos momentos, pero con una crítica cómica a los hechos más trascendentales de la actualidad.
                <br>
                <br>
                Inmediatamente después del éxito en su país, el programa comenzó su difusión por todo el mundo con
                similares resultados. En marzo de 2019, fue considerada por The Hollywood Reporter como la mejor serie
                de la historia, siendo también votada en 2018, según Ranked, como la mejor comedia de situación de
                todos los tiempos.
